  With this tool, you can explore how Cooling Degree Days (CDD) and
  Heating Degree Days (HDD), which are proxies for energy used to cool
  and heat buildings, are expected to change under different emissions
  scenarios and climate models. You can customize the metric for CDDs
  and HDDs by adjusting the base temperature as well as selecting the
  entire year or a specific portion of the year for inquiry.

  The underlying data are derived from daily climate projections that
  have been downscaled from global climate models from

  (LOCA) statistical technique developed by Scripps Institution Of Oceanography.
  LOCA is a statistical downscaling technique that uses past history to add
  improved fine-scale detail to global climate models.

  CDDs and HDDs are often used by utilities and other energy sector
  planners to understand energy demand for cooling and heating. As
  California’s climate changes, historical observed climate is becoming
  an increasingly poor proxy for future energy demand for cooling and
  heating. For example, an increase in the number and magnitude of hot
  days is expected to increase demand for air conditioning.

<h3>What is a Cooling Degree Day?</h3>
<p>
  A cooling degree day (CDD) is the number of degrees by which a daily
  average temperature exceeds a base temperature and may therefore
  require additional energy for space cooling.
</p>
<p>
  The base temperature is typically 65 °F, although different utilities
  and planning entities sometimes use different base temperatures. The
  base temperature loosely represents an average daily temperature below
  which space cooling (e.g. air conditioning) is not needed.
</p>
<p>
  The average temperature is the average of the minimum and maximum
  daily temperatures. CDDs can be summed over the entire year or over a
  portion of the year (e.g. the month of July) as a rough indicator of
  cooling energy used over that period.

<h3>What is a Heating Degree Day?</h3>
<p>
  A heating degree day (HDD) is the number of degrees by which a daily
  average temperature is below a base temperature and may therefore
  require space heating.
</p>
<p>
  The base temperature is typically 65 °F, although different utilities
  and planning entities sometimes use different base temperatures. The
  base temperature loosely represents an average daily temperature above
  which space heating is not needed.
</p>
<p>
  The average temperature is the average of the minimum and maximum
  daily temperatures. HDDs can be summed over the entire year or over a
  portion of the year (e.g. the month of January) as a rough indicator
  of heating energy over that period.
