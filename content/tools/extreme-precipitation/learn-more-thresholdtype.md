The extreme threshold sets the conditions for which a precipitation event is considered “extreme“. The threshold value is calculated from observed precipitation accumulation in the historical record (1961 to 1990).

By default, the threshold is set to the Lowest Annual Maximum value. Other alternatives are 90th, 95th and 99th percentiles. Selecting too high a threshold (in arid locations) or too low a threshold can decrease the reliability of the estimates.
