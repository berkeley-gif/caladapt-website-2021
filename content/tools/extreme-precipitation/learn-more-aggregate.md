Frequency estimates for polygons (e.g. a watershed) are calculated after spatially aggregating precipitation values for all intersecting grid cells. The default spatial aggregation option is Mean. Selecting the Maximum option aggregates the maximum values from all intersecting grid cells.

This option is used for polygon boundaries only and has no effect on individual grid cells.
