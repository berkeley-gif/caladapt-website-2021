Indicator estimates for polygons (e.g. a watershed) are calculated after spatially aggregating precipitation values for all intersecting grid cells. The default spatial aggregation option is <strong>Mean</strong>. Selecting the <strong>Maximum</strong> option aggregates the maximum values from all intersecting grid cells.

This option is used for polygon boundaries only and has no effect on individual grid cells.
