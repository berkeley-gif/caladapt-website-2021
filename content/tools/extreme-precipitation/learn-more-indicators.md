  <li><strong>Frequency</strong>: The number of Extreme Precipitation Events per water year.</li>
  <li><strong>Timing</strong>: The length of the season between the first Extreme Precipitation Events and the last.</li>
  <li><strong>Maximum Duration</strong>: The length of the longest stretch of consecutive Extreme Precipitation Events.</li>
