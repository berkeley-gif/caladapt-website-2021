  Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is a statistical methodology used for
  describing rare events. There are several ways to apply EVT to weather
  variables including fitting a Generalized Extreme Value distribution
  (GEV) over Block Maxima (annual maximum value) and the
  Peaks-Over-Threshold approach where probability distribution of
  exceedances over a pre-defined threshold are modeled using a
  generalized Pareto distribution. This tool explores extreme events in
  California using a Block Maxima approach.

  Annual Maximum values of the climate variable from a 21 day window
  around the day of interest are extracted from a 30 year daily
  timeseries for the Baseline Period (1991â€“2020). A GEV distribution for
  Temperature and an inverted Weibull distribution for Wind Speed is
  applied to this time series. Shape and scale parameters for the
  distribution are estimated using the Maximum Likelihood method.
  Exceedance Probabilities for different threshold values (return
  levels) are estimated from the fitted model with 95% confidence
  intervals.

  <strong>User Advisory</strong>: The Extreme Weather Tool is designed
  to broadly inform estimated probabilities of extreme weather events
  across a wide range of environments and climate zones in California.
  On a local scale, different statistical assumptions (i.e. fitting
  techniques for distribution parameters, choice of extreme value
  distribution) may be more appropriate. We encourage users to ensure
  the empirical fit of the applied distribution is acceptable to their
  end use before using estimates produced from this tool for planning
  purposes.
