  Climate simulations and scenarios produced for <a

  enable investigation of extreme, highly damaging climate changes that are
  possible but unlikely. One of these
  <em>low probability, high consequence events</em> is extreme drought.
</p>
<p>
  To explore extreme drought in a warmer future, two 20-year drought
  scenarios were produced from the LOCA downscaled meteorological and
  hydrological simulations (<a

    target="_blank">Pierce et al, 2018</a
  >). The first scenario covers the later part of this century from
  2051-2070 and was derived from LOCA downscaled HadGEM2-ES RCP 8.5
  simulation. The second scenario covers the earlier part of this
  century from 2023-2042. The precipitation during this scenario is
  daily LOCA downscaled precipitation in the sequence that it occurred
  from 2051-2070. However, the maximum and minimum temperatures are an
  adjusted version of 2051-2070 scenario that takes into account climate
  warming over the century.
