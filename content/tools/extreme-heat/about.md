  With this tool you can explore how the frequency and timing of extreme
  heat days and warm nights is expected to change under different
  emission scenarios. This data is derived from daily climate
  projections which have been downscaled from global climate models from
  the <a

  archive, using the

  > (LOCA) statistical technique developed by Scripps Institution Of Oceanography.
  LOCA is a statistical downscaling technique that uses past history to add
  improved fine-scale detail to global climate models.

  As the climate changes in California, one of the more serious threats
  to the public health of Californians will stem primarily from the
  higher frequency of extreme conditions, principally more frequent,
  more intense, and longer heat waves. An increase in heat waves may
  increase the risk of heat stroke and dehydration. Find out how you can
  become better prepared and more resilient to increasing temperature
  and extreme heat events at <a

<p class="h4">What is an extreme heat day?</p>
<p>
  For purposes of this tool, an extreme heat day or warm night is
  defined as a day in a year when the daily maximum/minimum temperature
  exceeds the 98th historical percentile of daily maximum/minimum
  temperatures based on observed historical data from 1961–1990 between
  April and October. Users have the option of setting a different value
  for threshold temperature or reset back to the 98th percentile value.

<p class="h4">What is a warm night?</p>
<p>
  For purposes of this tool, a warm night is defined as a day in April
  through October when the daily minimum temperature exceeds the 98th
  historical percentile of daily minimum temperatures based on observed
  data from 1961–1990. Users have the option of setting a different
  value for threshold temperature or reset back to the 98th percentile
  value.
</p>

<p class="h4">What is a heat wave?</p>
<p>
  Heat waves are characterized as durations of sustained, extreme heat,
  although there is no universal definition of a heat wave. For purposes
  of this tool, a heat wave is defined as a duration of 4 consecutive
  extreme heat days or warm nights when the daily maximum/minimum
  temperature is above the extreme heat threshold. Each 4 day/night
  duration is counted, so that if extreme temperatures persist for 10
  consecutive days/nights, it counts as 2 Heat Waves. Users have the
  option of choosing a different value for number of consecutive
  days/nights.
