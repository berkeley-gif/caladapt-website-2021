Choose from two 20 year planning horizons for near-term and long-term exposure assessments.

**Note:** The CoSMoS model provides flooding products under different return-interval storms combined with incremental SLR scenarios from 0–3 m (0–9.8 ft). The CalFloD3D-TFS model provides flooding datasets for combinations of 2 primary RCP scenarios, 4 priority climate models, 3 probabilistic SLR (50th, 95th, 99.9th percentiles) values and 5 planning horizons. For this tool, the CoSMoS flooding datasets for the 100-year-return interval and incremental SLR scenarios were cross-walked with the CalFloD3D-TFS datasets for two planning horizons based on maximum water level at the corresponding tide gauge locations during flood events. The Time Periods correspond to two of the five planning horizons used by CalFloD3D-TFS  – looking at the near future and the end of the century.
