The inundation scenarios from the 50m resolution CalFloD3D-TFS model are available for the entire California coastline and San Francisco Bay. The 5m resolution CalFloD3D-TFS model that uses more detailed topography, bathymetry, and building footprints is available for some areas along the coastline. Details are described in [Radke et al., 2018](https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2019-11/Energy_CCCA4-CEC-2018-012_ADA.pdf).

Inundation scenarios at 2m spatial resolution from different phases of the CosMoS modeling efforts are available for the California coastline and San Francisco Bay:

-   CoSMoS version 2.0 - The northern California coastline from Point Arena to the Marin Headlands
-   CoSMoS version 2.1 - San Francisco Bay
-   CoSMoS version 3.1 - The central California coastline from San Francisco to Santa Barbara
-   CoSMoS version 3.0 phase 2 - The southern California coastline from Santa Barbara to San Diego and the Channel Islands
