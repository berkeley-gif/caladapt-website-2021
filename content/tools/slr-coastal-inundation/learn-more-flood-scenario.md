The Flood Scenario represents the potential range of coastal inundation that may be experienced.

Note: The CoSMoS model provides flooding products under different return-interval storms combined with incremental SLR scenarios from 0–3 m (0–9.8 ft). The CalFloD3D-TFS model provides flooding datasets for combinations of 2 primary RCP scenarios, 4 priority climate models, 3 probabilistic SLR (50th, 95th, 99.9th percentiles) values and 5 planning horizons. For this tool, the CoSMoS flooding datasets for the 100-year-return interval and incremental SLR scenarios were cross-walked with the CalFloD3D-TFS datasets for two planning horizons based on **maximum water level at the corresponding tide gauge locations during flood events**. The Flood Scenarios correspond to the 3 probabilistic SLR values used by CalFloD3D-TFS.
