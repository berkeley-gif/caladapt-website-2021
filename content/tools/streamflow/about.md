  As temperatures increase and snowpack diminishes, streamflows are also
  projected to shift in their timing. Of particular concern in
  California is the spring snowmelt, which feeds streamflow when it is
  needed most for irrigation and energy purposes. This tool enables the
  user to explore the timing and magnitude of streamflow in selected
  months of the water-year, which runs from October 1 to September 30
  (i.e., water year 2018 runs from October 1, 2017 to September 30,
  2018).

  Because California’s major watersheds have been altered by large-scale
  projects such as dams and diversions, which enable human management of
  water to meet needs related to agriculture, urban uses, energy, and
  ecology, it would be misleading to do a straight comparison of
  “observed” streamflows at a given point. This obstacle is overcome
  through calculation of natural or “unimpaired” flows, which are what
  would occur if flows were not subjected to storage in reservoirs or to
  diversions (e.g., irrigation, power generation, water supply).
