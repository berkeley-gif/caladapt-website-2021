Cal-Adapt is California's official go-to source for downscaled climate data. Most people interact with Cal-Adapt through the website, but Cal-Adapt also features an API which can be used to query and download data through programming languages.

This hands-on workshop will teach you how to work with climate data using [caladaptR](https://ucanr-igis.github.io/caladaptr/), an R package which streamlines the process of importing data via the Cal-Adapt API. Through short hands-on exercises, you will learn how to construct API requests, fetch data from Cal-Adapt as data frames and rasters, and manipulate the results for analysis and visualization.

Please email the instructor Andy Lyons at andlyons@ucanr.edu with any questions.

## Workshop Details

The workshop will include hands-on exercises using R Notebooks, which require some very basic experience with R. Participants (especially beginners) are encouraged to use [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) (free account is fine), which allows you to run RStudio in a browser. A RStudio Cloud project with everything you need will be shared before the workshop. Alternately, participants may complete the exercises using RStudio Desktop (setup instructions to be provided). Familiarity with climate data and Cal-Adapt is helpful but not required.

The 90-minute workshop will include 1 hour of presentations and short exercises, followed by 30-minutes of self-paced practice where the instructor will be available for assistance. People who just want to get an overview of the workflow and run some sample code are welcome to drop off after an hour.

The workshop will cover:
- An introduction to importing Cal-Adapt climate data in R using caladaptR
- Constructing API request for specific climate variables, datasets, locations, and dates
- Fetching data via the Cal-Adapt API and getting results back as data frames and rasters
