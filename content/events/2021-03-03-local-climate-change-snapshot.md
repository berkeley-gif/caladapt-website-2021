### Webinar Description

Cal-Adapt just released the [Local Climate Change Snapshot Tool](/tools/local-climate-change-snapshot/) to provide accessible climate change data for a suite of climate change variables for any location of interest in California.

The tool is meant to make climate change information easy to understand and quick to access while supporting a variety of applications like municipal planning, community advocacy, and grant applications.

To offer more information about the tool and demonstrate how you can use it, Cal-Adapt is partnering with <a href="https://www.climateresolve.org/resilience-hubs/" target="_blank">Climate Resolve</a> to host a webinar.

The goals of this webinar are to:
* Introduce basic climate change data and show how data is hosted on Cal-Adapt
* Provide participants with a tour of the Local Climate Change Snapshot Tool
* Demonstrate how the Local Climate Change Snapshot Tool can be used in an Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities (AHSC) Program grant application with a demo by Natalie Hernandez from <a href="https://www.climateresolve.org/resilience-hubs/" target="_blank">Climate Resolve</a>
* Let participants ask questions about the tool, Cal-Adapt, and Climate Resolveâ€™s work
