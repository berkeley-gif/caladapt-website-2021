## Webinar Description

Cal-Adapt’s mission is to make data portraying climate change in California more accessible and actionable for a broad audience. We’ve recently redesigned Cal-Adapt to make it easier for new and existing users to learn about climate data, understand the tools and features on Cal-Adapt, and connect to other state resources available for climate adaptation and resiliency planning. In addition, we’ve revised Cal-Adapt tools to streamline and standardize the user experience of exploring and accessing climate data.

This webinar will showcase the launch of a revamped Cal-Adapt and introduce you to its new look and features.

The goals of this webinar are to:
* Introduce participants to Cal-Adapt’s new home page and Help features
* Provide a tour of our new Get Started content on climate science and best practices for using climate data
* Demonstrate a more streamlined user experience in our newest Extreme Weather tool
* Invite participants to ask questions about Cal-Adapt and share insights on suggested future enhancements

Our target audience for this webinar is a broad audience of energy sector stakeholders, state agency partners, local climate planners, community organizations, technical users, educators, and anyone with an interest in exploring climate change projections in California.

This webinar will be recorded and published on Cal-Adapt. We look forward to seeing you there! Please contact nethomas@berkeley.edu if you have any questions.
