## Webinar Description

The California Energy Commission and UC Berkeley’s Geospatial Innovation Facility (GIF) are jointly hosting a public webinar to introduce users to our new Data Download tool and to solicit input on the continued development of this and other tools on Cal-Adapt. Cal-Adapt is an interactive, publicly accessible web-based application providing easy-to-understand visualizations of locally relevant climate-related risks that enable users to explore research results and climate projections.

This webinar will highlight a variety of ways that users can discover and access climate data for California that is hosted on Cal-Adapt. Climate datasets on Cal-Adapt are provided by various scientific and research institutions and include historical observations and downscaled climate projections. The new Data Download tool allows users to exploit the pre-processing capabilities of the Cal-Adapt API, without needing to write computer code. Users can download temporal and spatial subsets in raster or tabular formats for [4 priority models](http://www.climateassessment.ca.gov/techreports/docs/20180827-Projections_CCCA4-CEC-2018-006.pdf) (HadGEM2-ES, CNRM-CM5, CanESM2, MIROC5) or 10 models selected by [California’s Climate Action Team Research Working Group](https://www.climatechange.ca.gov/climate_action_team/research.html) as having a good simulation of California's historical climate. This new download tool includes several improvements developed in response to user requests:
* Allows users to input multiple point or polygon locations and download climate variables in tabular format.
* Increased options for temporal and spatial aggregation for tabular download, including monthly, decadal, seasonal, and water year time steps.
* Improved discoverability of data in a searchable data catalog.

Cal-Adapt users can also download original NetCDF files for all downscaled climate models processed by data providers from the Cal-Adapt Data server and download data, charts, and visualizations directly from Cal-Adapt tools. In addition, users who require further customization can access data through the Cal-Adapt API.

From this webinar, we hope to provide an opportunity for interactive dialogue and information sharing to ensure that an expanded Cal-Adapt can directly support local climate change action and decision making. The goals of this webinar are to:
* Introduce participants to the new Data Download tool including temporal and spatial aggregations.
* Review additional methods of accessing data available through Cal-Adapt, including: accessing data, saving graphics through Cal-Adapt tools; downloading original NetCDF files; and using the API for additional customization.
* Gather feedback regarding the new Data Download tool and identify additional features that might be helpful to users.
* Invite feedback and discussion on additional new tools, visualizations, or features that can help support local climate adaptation and resilience planning.
