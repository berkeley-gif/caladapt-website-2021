## Webinar Description

The California Energy Commission and UC Berkeley’s Geospatial Innovation Facility (GIF) are jointly hosting a public webinar to introduce the data, tools, and features available through Cal-Adapt, and also to solicit input on the continued development of the site. Cal-Adapt is an interactive, publicly accessible web-based application providing easy-to-understand visualizations of locally relevant climate-related risks that enable users to explore research results and climate projections. As part of California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment, we have developed and released Cal-Adapt 2.0, which provides stakeholders with actionable information regarding local climate-related risks, including projected changes in sea level rise, wildfire risk, temperature, precipitation, snowpack, and more.

This webinar will describe the development of Cal-Adapt, introduce the new data and features, and provide an overview of the web application’s capabilities as well as examples of how it has already been used to aid resilience planning and policy in California. An expanded Cal-Adapt 3.0 is now underway, and the GIF team will present ideas for future enhancements and seek feedback on how Cal-Adapt could be further improved to meet stakeholder needs through additional resources, new data visualizations, or other features. From this webinar, we hope to provide an opportunity for interactive dialogue and information sharing to ensure that an expanded Cal-Adapt can directly support local climate change action and decision making.

The goals of this webinar are to:
* Introduce participants to the features, tools, and data available in Cal-Adapt 2.0.
* Gather feedback regarding the current visualizations and tools on Cal-Adapt 2.0 and what additional features would be most helpful to users.
* Elicit discussion and identify new tools, visualizations, or features that can help support local climate adaptation and resilience planning.
