UC Berkeley’s [Geospatial Innovation Facility](http://gif.berkeley.edu/) (GIF) and the [Governor’s Office of Planning and Research](https://www.opr.ca.gov/) (OPR) are pleased to invite you to a duo of energy sector-focused workshops for eliciting needs related to climate adaptation on September 12 in Sacramento at the California Energy Commission (Imbrecht Hearing Room). The day will include two user-focused workshops:
* Morning session (9:30 AM to noon) on Cal-Adapt 2.0
* Afternoon session (1:00 PM to 3:00 PM) on the State Adaptation Clearinghouse.

Participants are welcome to attend just the morning Cal-Adapt session, just the afternoon State Adaptation Clearinghouse session, or both.

## GIF Cal-Adapt Energy Sector User Needs Assessment Workshop

**September 12, 2017 from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM**, California Energy Commission (Imbrecht Hearing Room), Sacramento, CA

Cal-Adapt 2.0 has recently migrated from beta.cal-adapt.org to prime time at cal-adapt.org. The GIF will offer a tour of the new features and capabilities of Cal-Adapt 2.0, and then seek feedback on how Cal-Adapt 2.0, with its vastly expanded functionality and power, can serve electricity stakeholder needs through custom tools, visualizations, or other features. This workshop will include a live demo of the newly launched Cal-Adapt 2.0 site and then break out into focus groups to gather user feedback and guide potential new tool development around the following proposed topics:

* Climate Tools (Temperature, Precipitation, and Relative Humidity)
* Projected Wildfire Risks
* Stream Flows and other Hydrological Projections
* Cal-Adapt API

Please note that this workshop is part of an ongoing, CEC-funded [EPIC](http://www.energy.ca.gov/contracts/epic.html) grant to enhance Cal-Adapt and therefore focuses on electricity sector needs, although we do envision additional opportunities to weigh in on how Cal-Adapt may be able to serve additional needs in the future.

## OPR State Adaptation Clearinghouse Energy Sector User Needs Assessment Workshop

**September 12, 2017 from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM**, California Energy Commission (Imbrecht Hearing Room), Sacramento, CA

OPR’s workshop is one of a series of user needs assessments for the developing State Adaptation Clearinghouse. In 2015, Senate Bill 246 directed OPR to form the Integrated Climate Adaptation and Resiliency Program (ICARP). One main component of the Program is the State Adaptation Clearinghouse, which will serve as a centralized source of information and resources to assist decision makers at the state, tribal, regional, and local levels when planning for and implementing climate adaptation projects to promote resiliency across California. This workshop will first familiarize attendees with the Adaptation Clearinghouse and then break out into focus groups to have in depth discussions on the following topics:

* Case Studies and Climate Stories
* Tools and Resources
* Policies and Guidance
* Cal-Adapt and Custom Tool Development

From this workshop, OPR staff hope to collect information to insure that the Clearinghouse is a useful and effective resource that is consistent with existing tools and meets user needs, including possible development of “new” tools, visualizations, and features that support adaptation and resiliency efforts.

## Attending the Workshops
There is limited space for the number of in-person participants we can accommodate. We will keep a waiting list in the case that we receive more requests than we can host. There will also be a webinar option available for portions of the two events, but it will not be used
during breakout sessions and focus groups.

In-Person<br/>
Please RSVP for either/both workshops [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BZWBDSS).
