title: Can I get data for my specific project area?

You can upload your own file with a feature for spatial aggregation. Cal-Adapt supports zipped shapefiles, GeoJSON, KML, and WKT with one feature (point, line, or polygon) per file. If a file has multiple features, data will be returned for the full geographic extent of the file. The maximum supported area is 20,000 square miles.
