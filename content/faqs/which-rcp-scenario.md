title: Which RCP scenarios should I use in my analysis?
tags: tools

Representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios portray anticipated greenhouse gas concentrations through time, depending on future emissions. RCP scenarios are not specific policies, demographics, or economic futures; instead, they are defined by total radiative forcing by 2100. Two commonly-used RCP scenarios are incorporated in Cal-Adapt: RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5.

RCP 4.5 is described by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a moderate scenario in which emissions peak around 2040 and then decline. RCP 8.5 is the highest baseline emissions scenario in which emissions continue to rise throughout the twenty-first century. Therefore, climate change projections under RCP 8.5 will typically be more severe than projections under RCP 4.5. Cal-Adapt has chosen to display both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios in the tools to allow users to assess emissions-dependent variability and evaluate a moderate scenario alongside a worst-case scenario.

You should work with each RCP scenario separately, rather than aggregating or averaging values across RCP scenarios. Think of each RCP scenario as a distinct possible future.
