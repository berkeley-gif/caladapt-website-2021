**Citing information and visualizations (maps, charts, screenshots, etc.)**

Here’s an example of an American Psychological Association (APA) citation for information retrieved on Cal-Adapt:

<p class="reference">
Cal-Adapt. (2018). [Number of Extreme Heat Days for Census Tract ID 6055201800, RCP 4.5, Global Climate Models HadGEM2-ES, CNRM-CM5, CanESM2, MIROC5]. Cal-Adapt website developed by University of California at Berkeley’s Geospatial Innovation Facility under contract with the California Energy Commission. Retrieved [15 November 2019], from http://cal-adapt.org/tools/extreme-heat/.
</p>

**Citing data sources**

To cite the datasets hosted on Cal-Adapt, please cite the Cal-Adapt dataset and the original peer-reviewed paper or technical report that published the dataset.

Here’s an example APA-style citation for data derived by Cal-Adapt team from LOCA downscaled data:

<p class="reference">
Cal-Adapt. (2018). LOCA Derived Data [GeoTIFF]. Data derived from LOCA Downscaled CMIP5 Climate Projections. Cal-Adapt website developed by University of California at Berkeley’s Geospatial Innovation Facility under contract with the California Energy Commission. Retrieved September 16, 2020 from https://cal-adapt.org/
</p>

And here’s an example APA-style citation for the LOCA downscaled data:

<p class="reference">
Pierce, D. W., J. F. Kalansky, and D. R. Cayan, (Scripps Institution of Oceanography). 2018. Climate, Drought, and Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the Fourth California Climate Assessment. California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment, California Energy Commission. Publication Number: CNRA-CEC-2018-006.

All Cal-Adapt tools have a section that lists the datasets used.
