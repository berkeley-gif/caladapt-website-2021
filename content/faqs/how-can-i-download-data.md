There are many ways to download data on Cal-Adapt:
- Climate Tools
- Data Catalog
- Cal-Adapt File Server
- Cal-Adapt API

**Climate Tools**
All Cal-Adapt tools have Download button that you can click to download data and graphics displayed on screen. For a chart, this data download option works on an individual basis. Only the data available to you in that chart is exported. Any filters, date range controls, options selected, recalculations are also applied to the exported data. For downloading complete and original timeseries, use the [Data Catalog](/data).

**Data Catalog**
All datasets available on Cal-Adapt are listed in the [Data Catalog](/data). Search for the dataset you are interested in by entering a search critieria and/or filtering by climate variable, data producer. You will be prompted to follow a stepped process to identify a data format (GeoTIFF or csv), specify a spatial extent, set aggregation parameters, and then select from different scenarios and GCMs. NetCDF files for full spatial extent are available from the Cal-Adapt file server. Links to NetCDF files are displayed on screen during the data format selection step. 

**Cal-Adapt File Server**
We store climate data provided by California's scientific and research community in their original formats on the [Cal-Adapt File Server](http://albers.cnr.berkeley.edu/data/). You can download NetCDF files of gridded datasets and CSV files of station data from the server. Links to individual datasets are also included in the Data Catalog.

**Cal-Adapt API**
We process data provided California's scientific and research community and serve some of these through the [Cal-Adapt API](https://api.cal-adapt.org/api/). Learn more about the Cal-Adapt API or read the [API documentation](https://berkeley-gif.github.io/caladapt-docs/) to learn more.
