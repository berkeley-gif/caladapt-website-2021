title: What are priority models
tags: tools
---

Four models have been selected by California’s Climate Action Team as priority models for research contributing to California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment (Pierce et al., 2018). Projected future climate from these four models can be described as producing:

- A warm/dry simulation (HadGEM2-ES)
- A cooler/wetter simulation (CNRM-CM5)
- An average simulation (CanESM2)
- The model simulation that is most unlike the first three for the best coverage of different possibilities (MIROC5)

At minimum, you should work with ensemble (e.g. averaged) data from these four models; no one model should be used alone. By working with the four priority models instead of a single model, your analysis will better capture potential variability in future climate conditions.
