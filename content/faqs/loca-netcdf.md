tags: data

The individual NetCDF files are self-describing by design. Information about the dimensions and variables stored in the NetCDF file are readable by software tools. Contact and processing history are also generally stored as metadata in the NetCDF header and can be read by various software such as GDAL, NCO, CDO, QGIS, and ArcGIS.
