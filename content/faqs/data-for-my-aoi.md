You can identify data for your area of interest through any of the Cal-Adapt data download methods [link to the “how do I download data?” question] - using a tool, through the data download catalog, or using the API.

In the tools, you will be prompted to either select a location of interest [include screenshot of location selection inset?] or be able to zoom into an area of interest on a statewide map. If you are selecting a location of interest, you can also spatially aggregate data with a variety of inbuilt boundaries:
- 6 x 6 km grid cells
- HUC10 watersheds
- Climate zones
- Counties
- Census tracts with CalEnviroScreen 3.0 data
- Congressional districts (114th)
- Incorporated and census-designated places (2015)
- State of California
- Integrated Regional Water Management (IWRM) regions
- SWITCH load zones
- Electrical utility boundaries (investor- and public-owned)
- California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment regions

In accessing data through the data catalog, you will be prompted to select a spatial extent as the third step of the download process.
