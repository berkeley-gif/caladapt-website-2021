The modeled wildfire projections on Cal-Adapt were only generated for locations falling under state and federal fire protection responsibility. For more information on how these wildfire projections were generated, please review [Westerling et al. 2018](https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2019-11/Projections_CCCA4-CEC-2018-014_ADA.pdf).
