title: What tool should I use?
---

The tool that you use will depend on the general climate variable you are interested in (e.g., temperature, precipitation, or sea level rise) and the level of detail or customization you would like in interfacing with the climate projections. If you are new to Cal-Adapt or donâ€™t know where to start, we recommend you first visit the Local Climate Change Snapshot Tool. The Local Climate Change Snapshot Tool is designed to be straightforward and accessible for most users. If you would like an introduction to the tool, you can watch [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcXtv2LpWr0).

If you want to explore the data in more depth, [other tools](https://cal-adapt.org/tools/) on Cal-Adapt provide more configurable options.
