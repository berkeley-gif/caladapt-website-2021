Cal-Adapt typically represents the historical baseline as a thirty-year window from 1961 to 1990. In this period, most of California’s critical infrastructure was developed and the first signals of anthropogenic climate change were beginning to be felt.

The historical baseline you use for your analysis will be specific to your context, depending on the insights you’re working toward and the climate history of your locality.
