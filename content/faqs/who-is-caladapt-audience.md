Cal-Adapt was originally designed to serve energy-sector users planning climate change adaptations. Since its initial release, Cal-Adapt has expanded to serve users across California who are engaged in climate change analysis, mitigation, and adaptation. Cal-Adapt can also support climate change education in community and university settings.

Typically, some familiarity with climate science is necessary to fully harness Cal-Adapt’s resources. However, Cal-Adapt continually aims to serve its user base with the resources and support necessary to understand climate change projections and inform adaptation planning with quantitative and spatial information.
