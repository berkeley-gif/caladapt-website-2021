Data on Cal-Adapt include climate projections developed with funding from the California Energy Commission’s energy-related environmental research program, as well as other climate and weather data germane to California. These data are the products of peer-reviewed science and quality-controlled data collection efforts. Data sources and related publications are listed, described, and linked at the bottom of each tool. Much of the data currently on Cal-Adapt was generated in <a href="https://www.climateassessment.ca.gov/" target="_blank">California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment</a>.
