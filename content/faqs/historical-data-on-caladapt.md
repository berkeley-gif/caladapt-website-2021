title: What historical data does Cal-Adapt use?
tags: data
---

Cal-Adapt uses a historical observed daily dataset derived from approximately 20,000 NOAA Cooperative Observer (COOP) stations (Gridded Observed Meteorological Data, Livneh et al., 2015) from 1950–2013 at a spatial resolution of 1/16º (approximately 6 km). This dataset is a gridded product that was used for downscaling the Global Climate Models for California by Scripps Institution of Oceanography. This dataset provides a historical baseline for future projections.

As the dataset is a grid interpolated from observed point data, it's possible data for a grid cell doesn't exactly match up with station data within or near that grid cell (NCAR Climate Data Guide). 

**Why does the historical data end at 2006?**
The historical observed data (Gridded Observed Meteorological Data, Livneh et al., 2015) used in many Cal-Adapt tools has data from 1950–2013 at a spatial resolution of 1/16º (approximately 6 km). Visualizations on Cal-Adapt show historical data till 2005, as the future scenarios for the downscaled LOCA climate projections span from 2006–2099/2100.
