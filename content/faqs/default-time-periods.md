title: Why do Cal-Adapt tools default to certain time periods?

Cal-Adapt tools typically display statistics for thirty-year periods. 

<strong>Thirty years</strong> is the traditional length of record used in climatological studies and is known as a climatological normal. Thirty years is considered the minimum number of years needed to characterize a regional climate and for applying statistical tests. 

This aligns with best practice in climate science since climate is the long-term trend in prevailing weather conditions. Looking at a climate projection in any one year, or even a few years, is likely to be misleading for adaptation planning because variability is inherent to climate systems and longer-term trends cannot be determined based on a single year’s data.

The thirty-year periods in Cal-Adapt capture typical adaptation planning horizons and align with those used in [California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment](https://www.climateassessment.ca.gov/).

- **Historical Baseline (1961–1990)**. The historical baseline is chosen to represent the period in which the majority of California’s critical infrastructure was developed. This thirty year period represents the period in which anthropogenic climate change signals were beginning to be felt.
- **Mid–Century (2035–2064)**</strong>**. The mid-century epoch is a thirty year climatology centered about the middle of the 21st century at 2050.
- **End of Century (2070–2099)**. The late-century epoch include the last thirty years of the 21st century in which all model runs are available.
