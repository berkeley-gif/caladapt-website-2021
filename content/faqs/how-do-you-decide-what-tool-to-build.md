The interactive visualizations and easily accessible data currently available on Cal-Adapt reflect priorities articulated by users and the funding agencies who have provided support for making climate data accessible. Cal-Adaptâ€™s users are frequently consulted and engaged in beta-testing processes to evaluate website and tool prototypes. We are grateful to those who have provided refinements to developed tools and shared ideas to ensure that what is built is as useful as it can be. 

If you have ideas for tools that would support you in your work, feel free to email us at <support@cal-adapt.org>.
