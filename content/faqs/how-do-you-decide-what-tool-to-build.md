We develop our tools to meet our usersâ€™ needs! We frequently collect user ideas, develop beta versions, and work with users in beta testing processes to make sure that what we build is as useful as it can be. If you have ideas for tools that would support you in your work, feel free to email us at support@cal-adapt.org.
