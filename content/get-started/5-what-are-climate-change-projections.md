title: What are climate change projections?
order: 5

A climate change projection is a quantitative description of potential future climate conditions. Climate change projections are modeled using assumptions about future greenhouse gas emissions and general circulation models (GCMs). Sometimes, climate projections are further localized using regional circulation models and/or statistical downscaling techniques. When these models are run, they produce values for physical climate variables like precipitation and temperature for the time period and geography of interest.

Because they can be customized to incorporate potential emissions scenarios and assumptions about how global circulation patterns work, climate projections are used to ask “what if?” questions that explore the potential range of future climate conditions. Notably, climate projections are not weather forecasts - they tell us how conditions are likely to change on average, but they cannot tell us what will happen on any given date in the future.
