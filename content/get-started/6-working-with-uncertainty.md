Climate models have done an excellent job predicting increases in surface temperature. Climate models are powerful and effective tools for simulating the climate system, but there is some uncertainty inherent in any projection of the future.

**It is important to note that here the term "uncertainty" is being used in the scientific sense, to acknowledge that there is a range in possible future outcomes.**

When we discuss sources of uncertainty in the global climate models, we do not mean we are unsure whether climate change will affect California. That climate change is occurring and is caused by human activity is the consensus of the overwhelming majority of scientists engaged with the issue. What is less certain is the extent to which the climate will change in the future, and precisely how the changes will affect natural and human systems.

The [next section](/help/getting-started/7-how-to-use-climate-projections/) provides some recommended best practices for working with climate projections that take into account different sources of uncertainty.
