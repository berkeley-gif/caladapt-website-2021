## How do I access, visualize, and download climate data on Cal-Adapt?

There are three ways to access climate data on Cal-Adapt: by using a tool, going through the data download process, and using the Cal Adapt REST API.

### 1. Using a tool

The tools allow you to view climate projections for an area of interest. Each of Cal-Adapt’s tools focuses on a particular climate change variable(s) like extreme heat, sea level rise, or precipitation. To see the full list of tools and the climate variables they each capture, go to the tools page [link]. Once you’ve identified the data you’re interested in (including a time period, representative concentration pathway (emissions) scenarios, and general circulation model(s), if applicable), you can download the data and/or charts from the tool. For more information about choosing time periods, emissions scenarios, and models, see the section on best practices for working with climate data [link].

### 2. Going through the data download process

The data download process gives you access to Cal-Adapt’s full data catalog. The process guides you through a series of filters to help you identify the data you’re interested in and allows more customization options than the tools. You can also upload your own vector data to get data for the area you’re interested in.

### 3. Using the Application Programming Interface (API)

Cal-Adapt has a RESTful API that you may use to access climate data using computer programming languages such as Python or R. Cal-Adapt’s API makes it easy for you to build your own applications that harness the climate projections hosted on Cal-Adapt.
