## How is climate data relevant for decision-making?

Characterizing climate conditions is important when planning for the future in a variety of sectors, including municipal planning, natural resource stewardship, utility management, public health and safety programming, and private industry. By assessing the range of possible future conditions under a changing climate, you can plan adaptations that reduce the impacts of climate change and safeguard lives, livelihoods, and landscapes for decades to come.

### California’s changing climate

The [California Fourth Climate Change Assessment](https://www.climateassessment.ca.gov) produced updated climate projections that provide state-of-the-art understanding of different possible climate futures for California. The science is highly certain that California (and the world) will continue to warm and experience greater impacts from climate change in the future. Projected climate change trends are listed in the table below.

These trends will vary in magnitude and impact across California, so it’s important that adaptation planning uses data that are specific to the planning location and the climate hazards of concern in that location. To explore climate projections for a specific area, check out the Cal-Adapt tools associated with each climate variable. For additional information on the impacts of climate change in California, you can explore [California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment](https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2019-11/20180827_Summary_Brochure_ADA.pdf).

### Using climate data in adaptation planning

The way that you use climate data will depend on your particular needs, risk tolerance, and planning context. To support adaptation planning, the State of California has produced guidance materials, including:

- [Adaptation Planning Guide 2.0](https://resilientca.org/apg/)
- [State of California Sea Level Rise Guidance, 2018 Update](https://www.opc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/agenda_items/20180314/Item3_Exhibit-A_OPC_SLR_Guidance-rd3.pdf)
- [Planning and Investing for a Resilient California: A Guidebook for State Agencies](http://opr.ca.gov/docs/20180313-Building_a_Resilient_CA.pdf)

You can find a list of additional climate change adaptation planning resources on the [California Adaptation Clearinghouse](https://resilientca.org/apg/adaptation-planning-resources/).
