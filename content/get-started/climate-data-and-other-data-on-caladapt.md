## What climate data does Cal-Adapt provide?

Cal-Adapt hosts climate change projections and related data, much of which was generated for California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment. Most of the projections on Cal-Adapt were derived by statistically downscaling the outputs of global climate models (GCMs). You can learn more about general circulation models and downscaling at <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-do-climate-models-work" target="_blank">Carbon Brief's Q&A: How do climate models work?</a>

The main datasets hosted on Cal-Adapt are listed in the table below. For more information on how to access these datasets, see the FAQ article [How Can I Download Data?](/help/faqs/how-can-i-download-data/)

For a thorough explanation of how Cal-Adapt stores and makes accessible specific datasets, we recommend you read the <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2019-11/Projections_CCCA4-CEC-2018-015_ADA.pdf" target="_blank">Fourth Assessment report on Cal-Adapt</a>.

## What other data does Cal-Adapt provide?

In addition to hosting climate data, Cal-Adapt also hosts vector datasets containing administrative boundaries, hydrologic boundaries, and the LOCA (downscaling) model grid.

- LOCA model grid (1/16° – approximately 6 km on each side)
- California counties
- Watersheds (HUC10)
- Census tracts with CalEnviroScreen 3.0 scores
- 114th congressional districts
- Incorporated and census designated places (2015)
- Integrated Regional Water Management (IRWM) regions
- SWITCH load zones
- Climate zones
- Investor- and public-owned electrical utilities
- California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment regions
- State of California

These vector datasets can be used to select, view, aggregate, and summarize climate data for a geography of interest.

## Can I upload my own data?

Yes, you can upload your own file with a feature for spatial aggregation. Cal-Adapt supports zipped shapefiles, GeoJSON, KML, and WKT with one feature (point, line, or polygon) per file. If a file has multiple features, data will be returned for the full geographic extent of the file. The maximum supported area is 20,000 square miles.
