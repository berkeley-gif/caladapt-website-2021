## What climate data does Cal-Adapt provide?

Cal-Adapt hosts climate change projections and related data generated for California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment. Most of the projections on Cal-Adapt were derived by statistically downscaling the outputs of general circulation models (GCMs). You can learn more about general circulation models and downscaling here [link – Carbon Brief?](#).

The main datasets hosted on Cal-Adapt are listed in the table below. For more information on how to access these datasets, go to that section of the help documentation [link to help].

## What other data does Cal-Adapt provide?

In addition to hosting climate data, Cal-Adapt also hosts vector datasets containing administrative boundaries, hydrologic boundaries, and the LOCA (downscaling) model grid.

- LOCA model grid (1/16° – approximately 6 km on each side)
- California counties
- Watersheds (HUC10)
- Census tracts with CalEnviroScreen 3.0 scores
- 114th congressional districts
- Incorporated and census designated places (2015)
- Integrated Regional Water Management (IRWM) regions
- SWITCH load zones
- Climate zones
- Investor- and public-owned electrical utilities
- California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment regions
- State of California

These vector datasets can be used to select, view, aggregate, and summarize climate data for a geography of interest.
