<p>
  Characterizing climate conditions is important when planning for the future in
  a variety of sectors, including municipal planning, natural resource
  stewardship, utility management, public health and safety programming, and
  private industry. By assessing the range of possible future conditions under a
  changing climate, you can plan adaptations that reduce the impacts of climate
  change and safeguard lives, livelihoods, and landscapes for decades to come.
