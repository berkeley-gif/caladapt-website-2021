Welcome to Cal-Adapt! Cal-Adapt is a website that illustrates how climate change is projected to impact California. Cal-Adapt draws on peer-reviewed scientific studies and datasets to present climate change data visually and accessibly while maintaining scientific rigor.

Cal-Adapt is funded by the [California Energy Commission](http://www.energy.ca.gov/) and the [California Strategic Growth Council](http://sgc.ca.gov/). Cal-Adapt is designed, maintained, and updated by the [Geospatial Innovation Facility](href="http://gif.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California Berkeley. Cal-Adapt is steered by a [Technical Advisory Committee](/about) and the input of hundreds of users.

If you want to start exploring the data right away, our [Local Climate Change Snapshot](/tools/local-climate-change-snapshot) tool is a great place to start.
