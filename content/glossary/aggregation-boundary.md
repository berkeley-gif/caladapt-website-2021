title: Aggregation Boundaries

Because of the complexity of the climate system and limitation of computing power, Global Climate Models (GCMs) divide up the Earth into a series of boxes or "grid cells", with grid cells usually representing areas about 100km by 100km.

To get more representative projections for California's complex geography, GCMs are **downscaled**. 32 GCMs were downscaled using the Localized Constructed Analogues (LOCA) statistical method. In these downscaled models, each grid cell represents climate conditions within a square area of 6km by 6km (3.7mi by 3.7mi).

When users select a point location on the map, data is retrieved for the LOCA grid cells from different downscaled GCMs that intersect that point. Climate Tools on Cal-Adapt offer users an option to **spatially aggregate** data over an area. When users select a county or census tract, data retrieved represents the mean of all the grid cells that intersect area of interest.

Users can select from several different boundary layers. This selection varies with the Climate Tool.
