title: Return Period
---

A return period or return interval is the average period of time between occurrences of an event of a specified magnitude. For example, suppose a storm that delivers 5 inches of rain in 24 hours has occurred in a location 5 times in the past 100 years. A storm of that magnitude therefore has a return interval of 20 years in that location. Itâ€™s important to note that return intervals are computed with long-term records to describe long-term average conditions; 20-year storms may occur in back-to-back years, but on average, they occur every 20 year. Return periods for many meteorological phenomena are changing under climate change.
