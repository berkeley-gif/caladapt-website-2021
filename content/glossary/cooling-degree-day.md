title: Cooling Degree Day (CDD)
---

A cooling degree day (CDD) is the number of degrees by which a daily average temperature exceeds a reference temperature and may therefore require additional energy for space cooling.

The reference temperature is typically 65 degrees Fahrenheit, although different utilities and planning entities sometimes use different reference temperatures. The reference temperature loosely represents an average daily temperature below which space cooling (e.g. air conditioning) is not needed.

The average temperature is the average of the minimum and maximum daily temperatures. CDDs can be summed over the entire year or over a portion of the year (e.g. the month of July) as a rough indicator of cooling energy used over that period.
