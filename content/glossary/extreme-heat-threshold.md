title: Extreme Heat Threshold
---

The extreme heat threshold is the maximum daily temperature used to identify an extreme heat day. Typically, extreme heat thresholds are identified based on a location’s historical climate, since ecosystems and built infrastructure is usually adapted to historical climate.

Cal-Adapt’s [Extreme Heat Tool](/tools/extreme-heat) and [Local Climate Change Snapshot Tool](/tools/local-climate-change-snapshot) use a default extreme heat threshold temperature that is unique to every location. The default extreme heat threshold temperature is the 98th percentile of historical daily maximum temperatures for a place, computed using data from April through October for 1961 to 1990.

The extreme heat threshold temperature is set for every location in the [Local Climate Change Snapshot Tool](/tools/local-climate-change-snapshot) and cannot be changed. In the [Extreme Heat Tool](/tools/extreme-heat), users can either work with the default threshold temperature or input their own threshold temperature.
