CMIP5 stands for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5. According to the <a href="https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip" target="_blank">World Research Climate Programme</a>, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) aims “to better understand past, present and future climate changes arising from natural, unforced variability or in response to changes in radiative forcing in a multi-model context. This understanding includes assessments of model performance during the historical period and quantifications of the causes of the spread in future projections.”

In other words, CMIP studies the extent to which climate models agree with one another and evaluates reasons for any disagreement. Performance is compared across models by running each model with a standard protocol and set of assumptions.

CMIP5, the fifth phase of CMIP, was conducted between 2010 and 2014. CMIP5 refined the scientific community’s understanding of climate system dynamics, modeling techniques, and model performance. CMIP5 also addressed questions raised during earlier CMIP phases. The global climate models (GCMs) employed for the climate projections for California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment (and which are made available via Cal-Adapt) are from CMIP5.

CMIP6, the sixth phase of CMIP, is ongoing. The California Energy Commission is funding ongoing research that will downscale a new cohort of GCMs and projections for California from the CMIP6 archive.
