title: Snow Water Equivalent (SWE)
---

Snow water equivalent (SWE) is the amount of liquid water contained in a snowpack. Snow can vary in its density and structure, so snow water equivalent estimates allow different snowpacksâ€™ water contents to be compared.

SWE projections on Cal-Adapt are produced using a land surface and hydrology model known as the [Variable Infiltration Capacity](help/glossary/#variable-infiltration-capacity-(vic)-model) (VIC) model.
