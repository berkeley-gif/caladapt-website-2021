title: Extreme Precipitation Event
---

An extreme precipitation event is a weather event where precipitation (rain, snow, hail, etc.) is of a high (“extreme”) magnitude and greatly exceeds typical weather for a location and place. 

There is no single definition of what constitutes the threshold above which a precipitation event is considered “extreme.” Precipitation events can be extreme in their duration, maximum precipitation rate, total volume of precipitation delivered, or a combination of these three factors. Often, extreme precipitation events are identified based on their return period, or the long-term average period of time between events of a specified magnitude. A precipitation event with a 100-year return interval is expected to occur once in every 100-year period, on average, over the long term (e.g., thousands of years). Accordingly, the chance of a 100-year precipitation event occurring in a given year is 1%. However, climate change is altering the return interval of storms of given magnitudes. Extreme events are projected to occur more frequently, such that the return period of a given storm type is likely to decrease.
