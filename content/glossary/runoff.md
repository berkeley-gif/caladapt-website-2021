Water that is discharged into the streams and largely results from precipitation and melting of snow.

Runoff projections on Cal-Adapt are produced using a land surface and hydrology model known as the [Variable Infiltration Capacity](/help/glossary/#variable-infiltration-capacity-(vic)-model) (VIC) model.
