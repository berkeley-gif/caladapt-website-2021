title: Global Climate Model (GCMs)
---

A global climate model (GCM) is a mathematical model that represents the processes and interactions that drive the Earth’s climate. General circulation models incorporate the atmosphere, oceans, lands, and ice cover. Thirty-two global climate model simulations produced by institutions across the world served as a basis for California’s climate projections for California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment, and thus for the data available on Cal-Adapt.

The California Department of Water Resources’s Climate Change Technical Advisory Group reduced the larger ensemble of 32 GCMs to a more manageable set of 10 GCMs as being most suitable for California water resource climate change studies. For some study teams and users of California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment data, even the previously identified set of 10 GCMs was too much data. Accordingly, 4 of those 10 GCMs were identified whose project future climate can be described as producing:

- A “warmer/drier” simulation (HadGEM2-ES)
- An “average” simulation (CanESM2)
- A “cooler/wetter” simulation (CNRM-CM5)
- A “dissimilar” simulation that is most unlike the other three, to produce maximal coverage of possible future climate conditions (MIROC5)

Simulations produced with all climate models show substantial future warming; the “cooler/wetter” CNRM-CM5 simulation just shows less warming than the other models. The GCMs projections hosted on Cal-Adapt were generated for the periods 2006 to 2100 (future climate) and 1950 to 2005 (modeled historical climate).
