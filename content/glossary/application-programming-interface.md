title: Application Programming Interface (API)
---

An Application Programming Interface is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. An API is like a cog that allows two systems to interact with each other, for example a web browser on your computer with a server.

The Cal-Adapt API is built using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a>, <a href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org/" target="_blank">Django REST framework</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bkg/django-spillway" target="_blank">Django-Spillway</a>, an open source library developed at the GIF. The API follows an architectural style called REST (REpresentational State Transfer) which uses HTTP as the transport protocol for the message requests and responses.
