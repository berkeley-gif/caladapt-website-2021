title: Heat Wave Event
---

Heat waves are periods of sustained, extreme heat. Heat waves can jeopardize infrastructure, ecosystems, and public health (including people’s lives).

There is no universal definition of a heat wave. On Cal-Adapt, a default heat wave event is defined as a period of four consecutive extreme heat days or warm nights when the daily maximum temperature is above the extreme heat threshold. Cal-Adapt’s tool counts every four-day heat wave as a unique event. So if extreme temperatures persist for 8 consecutive days and nights, that is considered two heat wave events. If you would like to define your own heat wave duration, you can do that in the [Extreme Heat Tool](/tools/extreme-heat).
