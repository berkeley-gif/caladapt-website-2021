title: Heat Wave Event
---

Heat waves are characterized as periods of sustained, extreme heat, although there is no universal definition of a heat wave. For purposes of this tool, a Heat Wave event is defined as a period of 4 consecutive extreme heat days or warm nights when the daily maximum/minimum temperature is above the extreme heat threshold. 

Each 4 day/night period is counted, so that if extreme temperatures persist for 10 consecutive days/nights, it counts as 2 Heat Wave Events. Users have the option of choosing a different value for number of consecutive days/nights.
