title: Warm Night
---

A warm night is a night during which the minimum temperature does not fall below a defined threshold. Warm nights are concerning because buildings do not naturally cool down when overnight temperatures are warm, thereby potentially increasing overnight energy consumption for cooling and producing public health impacts such as heat stress and even excess mortality. Warm nights can also negatively impact ecosystems and water supplies, particularly snowpack.

The default warm night threshold temperature is the 98th percentile of historical overnight minimum temperatures for a place, computed using data from April through October for 1961 to 1990.

The warm night threshold temperature is set for every location in the [Local Climate Change Snapshot Tool](/tools/local-climate-change-snapshot) and cannot be changed. In the [Extreme Heat Tool](/tools/extreme-heat), users can either work with the default threshold temperature or input their own threshold temperature.
