title: Drought Scenarios
---


California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment uses two RCPs from the Fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report on Climate Change:

- Late 21st Century Drought: This scenario represents a late century dry spell from 2051–2070 identified from 
    the HadGEM2-ES RCP 8.5 simulation. The extended drought scenario is based on the average 
    annual precipitation over 20 years. This average value equates to 78% of historical median 
    annual precipitation averaged over the North Coast and Sierra California Climate Tracker regions..

- Early 21st Century Drought: This scenario represents an early century dry spell from 2023–2042 derived from the 
    late century drought scenario. The precipitation during this scenario is the same as 
    in the late century scenario, however the temperature has been adjusted to take into 
    account climate warming over the century..
