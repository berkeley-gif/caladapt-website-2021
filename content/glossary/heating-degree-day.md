title: Heating Degree Day (HDD)
---

A heating degree day (HDD) is the number of degrees by which a daily average temperature is below a reference temperature and may therefore require space heating.

The reference temperature is typically 65 degrees Fahrenheit, although different utilities and planning entities sometimes use different reference temperatures. The reference temperature loosely represents an average daily temperature above which space heating is not needed.

The average temperature is the average of the minimum and maximum daily temperatures. HDDs can be summed over the entire year or over a portion of the year (e.g. the month of January) as a rough indicator of heating energy over that period.
