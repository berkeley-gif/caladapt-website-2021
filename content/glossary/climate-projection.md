title: Climate Projection
---

A climate projection is a simulation of Earth's climate in future decades, given assumptions about future greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and how earth systems interact and react to those greenhouse gas concentrations.

Climate projections are generated using [global climate models](/help/glossary/global-climate-model) (GCMs) and are sometimes [downscaled](/help/glossary/downscaling) to produce data at fine spatial scales. All climate projections on Cal-Adapt have been downscaled. Climate projections can help us plan adaptations to climate change impacts. Notably, climate projections are not weather projections; they cannot tell us what the weather will be like on any given day or in a year in the future. Instead, climate projections tell us what conditions in the future are going to be like on average over long time periods, often expressed as 30-year periods called [climate normals](/help/glossary/climate-normal).

Even though it is not known how greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere will progress throughout the twenty-first century, climate projections for California generated using a suite of climate models all indicate with high certainty and agreement that temperatures will warm, sea level will rise, snowpack will decline, droughts will become more frequent and intense, extreme weather and precipitation events will become more frequent and variable, and wildfire risk will increase.
