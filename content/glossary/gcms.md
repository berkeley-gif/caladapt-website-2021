title: Global Climate Models (GCMs)
---

At their most basic level, Global CLimate Models (GCMs) represent the processes and interactions that drive the Earth’s climate. These cover the atmosphere, oceans, land and ice-covered regions of the planet.

GCMs are global, with grid cells usually representing areas about 100km by 100km. To get more representative projections for California's complex geography, GCMs are **downscaled**. 32 GCMs were downscaled using the Localized Constructed Analogues (LOCA) statistical method. In these downscaled models, each grid-cell represents climate conditions within a square area of 6km by 6km (3.7mi by 3.7mi).

A group of experts identified 10 GCMs from the 32 available as being most suitable for California water resource climate change studies. A further selection of 4 GCMs from these 10 GCMs were selected whose projected future climate can be described as producing: 
1. A “warm/dry” simulation (HadGEM2-ES) 
2. An “average” simulation (CanESM2)
3. A “cooler/wetter” simulation (CNRM-CM5)
4. The model simulation that is most unlike the first 3, for the best coverage of different possibilities (MIROC5) 

All simulations show substantial future warming; the “cooler” simulation just shows less warming than other models. The GCMS presented here make predictions for the period of 2006 to 2100, and recreate the historical climate for the period 1950 to 2005.
