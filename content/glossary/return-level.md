title: Return Level
---

A return level is the estimated threshold amount or intensity of an extreme or rarely occurring event. For example, the return level of a 100-year storm is the estimated amount of precipitation that would be expected to be exceeded once every 100 years, on average. In Cal-Adapt tools like the Extreme Precipitation tool that explore extreme events, the return level is estimated from the statistical distribution of modeled future climate scenarios.
