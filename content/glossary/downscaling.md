title: Downscaling
---

Downscaling is a modeling method used to create finer-resolution outputs from coarser-resolution climate models. Commonly used downscaling methods include statistical downscaling and dynamical (regional simulation) downscaling. Much of the data hosted on Cal-Adapt has been statistically downscaled using locally constructed analogs (LOCA) so that data are available for a grid composed of roughly 6-kilometer by 6-kilometer cells. LOCA downscaling uses global climate model projections and observed historical patterns of the relationship between the coarse and the fine-scale to develop fine-scale model projections for the future. For more information on LOCA downscaling, visit the [Get Started](/help/get-started/) page.
