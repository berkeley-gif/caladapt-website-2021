Annual average minimum temperature is the average of the coldest (minimum) temperatures for every day in a year.

We calculated these data for each model by selecting each dayâ€™s lowest projected temperature and then averaging those daily lows across the entire year. Annual average minimum temperature is presented for calendar years (January 1 to December 31).
