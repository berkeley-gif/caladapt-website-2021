title: Annual Average Precipitation
---

Annual average precipitation is the amount of total precipitation in the form of rain or snow over the course of a year.

The [global climate models](/help/glossary/#global-climate-model-(gcms)) (GCMs) hosted on Cal-Adapt produced average precipitation rates for 24-hour periods. We converted daily average precipitation rates for each model into inches of precipitation per day. We then summed the daily precipitation amount across each year to determine annual average precipitation. Annual average precipitation values on Cal-Adapt are typically presented for calendar years (January 1 to December 31).
