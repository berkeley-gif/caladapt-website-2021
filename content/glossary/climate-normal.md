title: Climate Normal
---

A climate normal (also called a climatological normal) is a thirty-year average of a weather variable, such as daily maximum temperature or annual precipitation, for a given time of year. Climate normals are useful because they translate weather patterns into standardized descriptions of climate. Climate normals are used to compare climate across time and place and provide context for year-to-year variability in weather and climate.

Cal-Adapt recommends that you use climate normal time periods to assess both historical climate baselines and future climate conditions. Many Cal-Adapt tools pre-select time periods for you that align with frequently used climate normals:

- 1961-1990: historical baseline
- 2035-2064: mid-century
- 2070-2099: end-of-century
