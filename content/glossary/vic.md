title: Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model
---

The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model is a large-scale hydrologic-land surface model that can be used to model the movement of water through the atmosphere and across a landscape. LOCA-downscaled precipitation and temperature data are used as inputs to the VIC model to produce estimates of evapotranspiration, runoff, soil moisture, [snow water equivalent](snow-water-equivalent), relative humidity, and other precipitation-related variables. Details are described in:
