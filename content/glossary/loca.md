title: Localized Constructed Analogs (LOCA)
---

Localized Constructed Analogs (LOCA) is a statistical downscaling technique that uses past climate history to add fine-scale detail to coarse global climate model outputs.

LOCA data covering California are resolved to 6 square kilometers, meaning that unique climate projection values are available for each 6-kilometer by 6-kilometer grid cell. For more details, see:
