title: Daily Precipitation
---

Daily precipitation in climate models represents all water that falls as rain or snow. In climate models, precipitation is modeled as a precipitation rate with units in kg/m2/s. 1 kg/m2/s is equivalent to 1 mm/s. 

When you download datasets from the Cal-Adapt data server or the Data Download Tool, the data may be in the original units of kg/m2/s. To convert the values to mm/day multiply by 86,400 (24 hours/day x 60 minutes/hour x 60 seconds/minute). To convert values to inch/day multiply by 3,401.57.

Precipitation data used in Cal-Adapt climate tools are already converted into mm/day or inches/day, so any precipitation datasets you download from climate tools will list values in those units.
