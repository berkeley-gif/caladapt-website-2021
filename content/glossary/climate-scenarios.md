title: Climate Scenarios (RCPs)
---

Changes in global and California temperatures depend on the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases emitted from human activities in the atmosphere. The future emissions and resulting accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) could take a range of pathways depending on the success of international and local eforts to reduce GHG emissions. 

The warming and other changes experienced under diferent future conditions are projected using **Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)**. RCPs do not represent a specifc policy, demographic, or economic future, but are defned in terms of their total radiative forcing (Watts per square meter) by 2100 (i.e., the net balance of radiation into and out of Earth’s surface due to human emissions of GHGs from all sources).

In other words each RCP represents a standardized set of assumptions of humanity’s trajectory in the coming years.

The **Medium Emissions Scenario (RCP 4.5)** represents a mitigation scenario where global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions peak by 2040 and then decline. Statewide for California, temperature is projected to increase 2-4 °C for this scenario by the end of this century.

The **High Emissions Scenario (RCP 8.5)** represents a scenario where CO<sub>2</sub> emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century. Statewide for California, temperature is projected to 4-7 °C by the end of this century.
