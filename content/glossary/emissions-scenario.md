title: Emissions Scenario
---

An emissions scenario is a representation of future greenhouse gas emissions and resulting atmospheric concentrations through time. An emissions scenario illustrates a plausible future so that climate projections for that emissions scenario can be generated, used to inform analysis and decision-making, and compared to other scenarios.

Changes in global and California temperatures depend on the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases emitted from human activities in the atmosphere. Future emissions and resulting accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) could take a range of pathways depending on the success of international and local efforts to reduce GHG emissions and sequester GHGs.

Warming and other climatological changes experienced under different plausible future conditions are projected using representative concentration pathways (RCPs). RCPs are defined in terms of their total radiative forcing by 2100 (i.e., the net balance of radiation into and out of Earth’s surface due to human emissions of GHGs from all sources, measured in watts per square meter of Earth’s surface). In other words, each RCP represents a standardized set of assumptions about the human-influenced GHG trajectory in the coming years. RCPs do not represent a specific policy, demographic, or economic future.

California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment uses two RCPs from the Fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report on Climate Change:

- RCP 4.5 (medium emissions scenario): a mitigation scenario where GHG emissions peak by 2040 and then decline. In California, annual average temperatures under this scenario are projected to increase 2°C - 4°C by the end of this century, depending on the location.

- RCP 8.5 (high emissions scenario): a no-mitigation scenario where global GHG emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century. In California, annual average temperatures under this scenario are projected to increase 4°C - 7°C by the end of this century.
