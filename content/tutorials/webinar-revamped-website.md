Cal-Adapt’s mission is to make data portraying climate change in California more accessible and actionable for a broad audience. We’ve recently redesigned Cal-Adapt to make it easier for new and existing users to learn about climate data, understand the tools and features on Cal-Adapt, and connect to other state resources available for climate adaptation and resiliency planning. In addition, we’ve revised Cal-Adapt tools to streamline and standardize the user experience of exploring and accessing climate data.

This webinar, recorded on December 9th, 2021, showcases the launch of a revamped Cal-Adapt and introduces you to its new look and features.

The goals of the webinar are to:

- Introduce participants to Cal-Adapt’s new home page and Help features
- Provide a tour of our new Get Started content on climate science and best practices for using climate data
- Demonstrate a more streamlined user experience in our newest Extreme Weather tool
- Gather participants questions about Cal-Adapt and share insights on suggested future enhancements

Our target audience for this webinar is a broad audience of energy sector stakeholders, state agency partners, local climate planners, community organizations, technical users, educators, and anyone with an interest in exploring climate change projections in California.
