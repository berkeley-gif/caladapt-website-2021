// MEDIA QUERIES
// These use the `include-media` Sass library
// https://eduardoboucas.github.io/include-media/
// Breakpoint variables are configured to match Carbon Design's grid breakpoints.
// Note that custom `@include media(a, b)` may also be created, e.g.
// `@include media(">=small", "<800px") { ... }`
// Note that these were added 2022-04-27 and are not used widely yet across the app

// use when applying media queries for desktop width viewports
@mixin desktop {
  @include media(">large") {
    @content;
  }
}

// use when applying media queries for both tablet & mobile width viewports
@mixin mobile-tablet {
  @include media("<=large") {
    @content;
  }
