    <h2>About the Tool</h2>
    <p>
      Overall temperatures are projected to rise substantially throughout this
      century. These projections differ depending on the time of year and the
      type of measurement (highs vs. lows), all of which have different
      potential effects to the state's ecosystem health, agricultural
      production, water use and availability, and energy demand. On average, the
      projections show little change in total annual precipitation in
      California. Furthermore, among several models, precipitation projections
      do not show a consistent trend during the next century. The Mediterranean
      seasonal precipitation pattern is expected to continue, with most
      precipitation falling during winter from North Pacific storms. However,
      even modest changes would have a significant impact because California
      ecosystems are conditioned to historical precipitation levels and water
      resources are nearly fully utilized.

      With this tool you can explore projections of annually averaged maximum
      temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation. These climate
      projections have been downscaled from global climate models from the <a

      LOCA is a statistical downscaling technique that uses past history to add improved
      fine-scale detail to global climate models.
