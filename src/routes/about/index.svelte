          Cal-Adapt has been designed to provide access to the wealth of data and information that has been, and continues to be, produced by State of California's scientific and research community. The data available on this site offer a view of how climate change might affect California at the local level. Here you can work with visualization tools, access data, and participate in community sharing to contribute your own knowledge. Cal-Adapt&#39;s development is a key recommendation of the 2009 California Climate Adaptation Strategy.

        <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
        <p>
          Amy Luers, then of Google.org, articulated the original need and vision for the creation of Cal-Adapt, and was instrumental in securing funding for its development. Dylan Beaudette, Vishal Mehta, and David Purkey from the Stockholm Environmental Institute created an initial prototype that formed a basis for the original (June 2011) release of Cal-Adapt. We also thank Shannon Koy for her valuable contribution to the graphic design and layout of the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cal-Adapt&#39;s current design and functionality have been developed with the insight from a variety of beta testers and advisory committee members who provided valuable feedback throughout several iterations of updates. These individuals represent scientists and climate experts, planners and technicians, and leaders in development of local climate policy, as well as interested participants from the general public.
